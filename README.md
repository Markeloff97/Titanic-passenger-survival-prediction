# Titanic-passenger-survival-prediction

**Background:** The most infamous stories of a shipwreck include the RMS Titanic, which is known 
worldwide and also has a movie based on it. But although the Titanic tragedy occurred well 
over a century ago, scientists and statisticians are still interested in learning why some 
passengers escaped and others did not.

**Aim:** The main purpose of this study will be to use the Titanic Dataset provided to predict the 
survival of the onboard passengers using different supervised machine learning algorithms.

**Methods:** Predicting the survival of onboard passengers of the titanic using supervised machine 
learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Tree, and Na√Øve Bayes with the 
help of different categorical and numerical variables present in the dataset. KNIME Data 
Analytics Software will be used to carry out the necessary operations for this study.
